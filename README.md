## Shopping Website

An E-Commerce website that allows users to add products to a shopping cart and calculates the total cost of items added. Utilises local storage so products are saved. Product details are displayed on the front-end using JSON.

## Lessons Learned

This project allowed me to practice incorporating features that are typically included in e-commerce's/shopping websites.

I utilised JavaScript to include a shopping cart that displayed products that users have added products to. The product details are placed inside of
a JSON file and I used Fetch API to access the data to be displayed on the front-end.

This is a simple e-commerce that lacks a lot of features that are seen in modern shopping websites. These include the ability to login to an account and make
a payment to purchase products. I plan to include such features in due course.

## Future Updates

• Add checkout page that displays products placed into cart.

• Include login page

## Deployment

Website was deployed with Vercel.
